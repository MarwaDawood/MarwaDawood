        <p class="text-2xl p-7 font-display "> As a highly motivated and detail-oriented junior full-stack developer, I am dedicated to creating innovative solutions that drive business success. With five years of experience in retail and people management, I thrive in high-pressure environments and am committed to delivering exceptional results.
        Out of more than 1000 applicants, I was selected to participate in the School of Code's intensive 16-week full-stack software development bootcamp. During the program, I gained valuable hands-on experience in front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Additionally, I gained proficiency in back-end development with technologies like Node and Express. Through the bootcamp, I learned to work with RESTful APIs and gained practical experience in storing and retrieving data from databases. Furthermore, I gained familiarity with testing and used tools such as Jest and Cypress to ensure the quality of my code.
